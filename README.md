# SONOFF_WEMO_ALEXA
A replacement script for the sonoff basic device

This file has been taken mostly from 
https://github.com/kakopappa/arduino-esp8266-alexa-wemo-switch

unfortunately, i'm not a Github guru, so im not sure of the protocol for working with someone elses scripts, but that is where the credit for this program should go.

# My basic changes:

  1. the device name is now at the top of the script to make it simpler for quick changes
  2. The GPIO devices are correct for the sonoff device
  3. the information printed via serial, now displays the device mac address should you require to give it a static IP
  
To do:

  1. make the device switch operate the lamp.
  
#I'll reiterate - all credit to kakopappa!!
